Pacific Trails Resort 
 
Summary:
 
Completed: December 2015
 
I created this website from scratch as part of the HTML/CSS course. The goal was to learn how to build a responsive website using HTML5, CSS3 and media queries. I was given guidelines on what to add for the website and how to make it look. This process taught me the basics of HTML and CSS such as building a navigation bar, creating a table with cells and borders, adding an image, creating a footer and linking to other pages. I also learned the different types of cascading styles sheets such as (Internal, Embed, External and Inline) and how to use them.
 
Challenges:
In the beginning, I struggled with the CSS box model, positioning and elements not showing up the way I expected. However, I found myself discovering better coding practices and skills to solve the issues I was having.
 
 
What I learned:
 
Researching problems I'm having during coding has helped me so much during this process. It led me to great tools and online resources such as Chrome DevTools, Stack Overflow, CSS Tricks, Mozilla Developer Network, Dev Tips and many others.
